# AOC 2025 in Godot

## TL;DR

Made some of them in both JS and GdScript.
Kept the puzzle files and answers outside of git, as one should in AOC. Only the simple puzzles are kept in.

For JS, host locally as instructed in its README.md.
For Godot, set the scene you want to see as main scene to run it.
Used stable Godot 4.5.
