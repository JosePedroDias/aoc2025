# AOC 2025

## TL;DR

Made most puzzles in JavaScript.
Some also in Godot/GdScript.

Kept the puzzle files and answers outside of git, as one should in AOC. Only the simple puzzles are kept in.

## For JS

```
nvm use latest
npx http-server -c-1 --cors . &
```

http://localhost:8080/js/01.html

## For Godot

For Godot, set the scene you want to see as main scene to run it.
I used stable Godot 4.5.
